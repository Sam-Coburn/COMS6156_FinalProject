# COMS6156_FinalProject
## Sam Coburn & Jessica Kim | Spring 2022

1. **Code Embeddings** - contains all 600 code embeddings we derived for the project
2. **Dataset 1 - Pervasive Modifications** - contains the original Java file dataset
3. **Dataset 2 - Krakatau** - contains the Java file dataset after using the decompiler Krakatau
4. **Dataset 3 - Procyon** - contains the Java file dataset after using the decompiler Procyon
5. **Graphs** - contains the graphs that we derived for analysis (i.e. F1 curves, Precision@N curves, ROC curves)
6. **Project Documents** - contains documents submitted as deliverables for the project (i.e. project proposal, progress report)
7. **Related Work** - contains the papers we referenced or are related to our work
8. **Spreadsheets** - contains spreadsheets that organize the code embeddings on file and model used, as well as the similarity analytics
9. **code2vec** - a copy of the code2vec repository, which we used to download and train the Java14 and Java-Large models
10. **code_embeddings.py** - Python program of the functions we implemented in order to analyze the similarity between code embeddings (i.e. cosine similarity, F1 scores, precision@n)
11. **demo.py** - Python program of the class demo which demonstrates the analytical graphs and functions we implemented based on a few sample code embeddings
